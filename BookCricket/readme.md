How game works-

1. The book is _almost equally_ divided into 3 sections, left | middle | right.
2. As the player chooses a section, the book will be opened and the even numbered side's unit digit will be the user's score.
3. One inning is every player playing one turn in the order of registration.
4. At the end of each inning, the current score and status (out/not) will be displayed.
5. The players who are out in an inning will not be able to play during the next innning.
7. If you get a 0, you are out! Any other score will be added to your total.
8. You can keep playing till you either get out or score more than your opponents after they are out.
9. The player with maximum score wins.
